# Phase 05: Registry & Configuration

**Phase**: 05  
**Title**: Registry & Configuration  
**Area**: OS API Layer (win32_sdl_api_compat)  
**Scope**: SMALL  
**Status**: not-started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 02, Phase 03

## Quick reminders

- Use `Fail fast` approach when testing new changes, if something is not working as expected, stop and investigate immediately;
- Focus on finish `GeneralsXZH`, then backport to `GeneralsX`;
- See `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md` for more specific details about above instructions.

## Objective

Replace Windows Registry with INI-based configuration system.
