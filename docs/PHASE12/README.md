# Phase 11: Texture System

**Phase**: 11  
**Title**: Texture System  
**Area**: Graphics Layer (d3d8_vulkan_graphics_compat)  
**Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: not-started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 06, Phase 10

## Objective

Vulkan texture creation, loading, and GPU management

---

## Key Deliverables

- [ ] VkImage allocation with format conversion
- [ ] VkImageView creation
- [ ] Texture layout transitions
- [ ] Staging buffers for GPU upload
- [ ] Format support: RGBA8, BC1/2/3 DXT compression

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Build & Compilation
