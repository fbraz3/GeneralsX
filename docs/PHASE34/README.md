# Phase 34: Multiplayer & Networking

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 weeks  
**Priority**: LOW - Final polish feature

## Overview

Implement multiplayer networking system with replay compatibility, starting with same-platform networking and planning for future cross-platform support.

## Tasks

### Phase 34.1: Same-Platform Networking (1 week)

- Local network discovery (LAN)
- Host/join game lobby system
- Synchronization protocol
- Network packet handling
- Latency compensation

### Phase 34.2: Replay System Compatibility (1 week)

- Replay recording infrastructure
- Command serialization
- Replay playback engine
- Fast-forward/rewind controls
- Replay file format validation

### Phase 34.3: Network Protocol Refinement (1 week)

- Connection stability improvements
- Disconnect handling and reconnection
- Anti-cheat validation (checksum verification)
- Bandwidth optimization
- Error recovery mechanisms

### Phase 34.4: Testing & Documentation (3-5 days)

- LAN multiplayer testing
- Replay recording/playback validation
- Network performance profiling
- Documentation updates

## For Future Implementation

### GameSpy Replacement

- OpenSpy integration (open-source GameSpy alternative)
- Integration with "playgenerals.online" initiative
  - Repository: https://github.com/GeneralsOnlineDevelopmentTeam/GameClient
- Matchmaking server infrastructure
- Player statistics and rankings

### Cross-Platform Networking

- Protocol compatibility between Windows/macOS/Linux
- Endianness handling for cross-architecture
- Platform-specific network optimizations
- Cross-platform game session management

## Files to Modify

- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/Common/Network/` - Networking systems
- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/Common/Replay/` - Replay recording
- `cmake/gamespy.cmake` - Network library configuration

## Success Criteria

- ✅ LAN multiplayer games work (2+ players)
- ✅ Replay recording captures full game
- ✅ Replay playback matches original game
- ✅ Network synchronization stable (no desyncs)
- ✅ Acceptable latency (< 100ms on LAN)

## Dependencies

- Phase 30: Metal Backend ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 31: Texture System (for UI)
- Phase 32: Audio System (for network events)
- Phase 33: Game Logic Validation (stable gameplay)

## Notes

Multiplayer is the final major feature for GeneralsX 1.0 release. Focus on stability and compatibility with original game replays. Cross-platform networking is a stretch goal for future versions.
