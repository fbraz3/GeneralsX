# Phase 36: Merge from TheSuperHackers Repository

Since this project is a fork from the superhackers project, times by times we need to merge and fix the conflicts.

- Loccaly we have a remote called `superhackers`
- Need to merge - it will cause a lot of conflicts
- Solve the conflicts
- Fic any code that is necessary to ensure we can get the same state of execution from phase 35.
