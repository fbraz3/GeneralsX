# PHASE 08: Descriptor Sets & Layouts

**Date**: November 11, 2025  
**Phase Number**: 08  
**Objective**: Create VkDescriptorSet system for binding uniforms, textures, samplers  
**Dependencies**: PHASE05, PHASE07  
**Estimated Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: not-started  

---

## Overview

This phase implements:
- Resource binding
- Integration with previous phases
- Testing and validation

---

## Key Deliverables

- ✅ Dynamic uniform binding
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ No memory leaks

---

## Technical Approach

### Core Implementation Pattern

```cpp
// Implementation structure
// (Details to be filled during implementation)
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Checklist)

- [ ] Feature fully implemented
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Code reviewed and documented
- [ ] Integrated with previous phases

---

## Implementation Files

**Files to Create**:
- (To be determined during phase)

**Files to Modify**:
- (To be determined during phase)

---

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration testing with previous phases
- Performance profiling
- Memory leak detection

---

## Next Phase

PHASE09
