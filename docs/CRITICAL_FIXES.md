# Critical Fixes - GeneralsX macOS Port

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: üö® URGENT SAFETY FIXES APPLIED

## Issue #1: Fullscreen Lock (System Freeze)

### Problem
- Game opens fullscreen with blue-gray screen
- **Complete loss of keyboard/mouse control**
- All keyboard shortcuts disabled (ESC, Cmd+Q, Cmd+Tab)
- **Requires hard system reset** (power button)
- Critical safety issue preventing any testing

### Root Cause
SDL2 fullscreen mode captures all input events but the game's SDL event loop didn't implement emergency exit handlers for ESC or Cmd+Q, causing complete system lock.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Emergency Exit Handlers (Win32GameEngine.cpp)
```cpp
case SDL_KEYDOWN:
    // EMERGENCY EXIT: Allow ESC or Cmd+Q to exit fullscreen
    if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_ESCAPE) {
        printf("EMERGENCY EXIT: ESC pressed - quitting immediately\n");
        setQuitting(true);
    }
    // Cmd+Q on macOS (or Alt+F4 equivalent)
    if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_q && (event.key.keysym.mod & KMOD_GUI)) {
        printf("EMERGENCY EXIT: Cmd+Q pressed - quitting immediately\n");
        setQuitting(true);
    }
```

#### 2. Force Windowed Mode on macOS (W3DDisplay.cpp)
```cpp
// SAFETY: Force windowed mode on macOS to prevent fullscreen lock
// User can manually toggle fullscreen with Cmd+F if needed
#ifdef __APPLE__
bool forceWindowed = true;
if (!TheGlobalData->m_windowed && forceWindowed) {
    printf("SAFETY: Forcing windowed mode on macOS to prevent fullscreen lock\n");
    TheWritableGlobalData->m_windowed = true;
}
#endif
```

### Impact
- ‚úÖ No more system freezes
- ‚úÖ ESC key now exits game immediately
- ‚úÖ Cmd+Q works for emergency quit
- ‚úÖ Game starts in windowed mode (safe default)
- ‚úÖ Can test without risk of hard reset

## Issue #2: NULL Surface Crash (EXC_BAD_ACCESS)

### Problem
```
EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x18)
frame #0: SurfaceClass::Peek_D3D_Surface(this=0x0000000000000000)
frame #1: Render2DSentenceClass::Build_Textures()
```

Game crashes when rendering 2D text due to NULL pointer dereference in `texture_surface->Peek_D3D_Surface()`.

### Root Cause
`TextureClass::Get_Surface_Level()` returns NULL for certain texture formats (particularly format 7 - unsupported formats), but code didn't check for NULL before calling `Peek_D3D_Surface()`.

### Solution Applied (render2dsentence.cpp)

```cpp
TextureClass *new_texture = W3DNEW TextureClass(...);
SurfaceClass *texture_surface = new_texture->Get_Surface_Level();

// Phase 28.10.2: NULL texture_surface protection
if (texture_surface == NULL || texture_surface->Peek_D3D_Surface() == NULL) {
    printf("RENDER2D PROTECTION: Skipping NULL texture_surface for texture %p\n", new_texture);
    REF_PTR_RELEASE (new_texture);
    REF_PTR_RELEASE (curr_surface);
    continue;
}
```

### Impact
- ‚úÖ No more crashes when rendering text
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of unsupported texture formats
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for debugging texture issues
- ‚úÖ Engine continues running even with NULL surfaces

## Issue #3: Metal Backend Thread Crash

### Problem
```
EXC_BAD_ACCESS in AGXMetal13_3 (Apple Metal driver)
frame #0: AGXMetal13_3`std::__hash_table::__do_rehash
```

Metal shader compilation in background threads causing memory corruption and crashes.

### Root Cause
Metal backend was initializing synchronously during engine startup, but Apple's Metal driver performs shader compilation asynchronously in background threads. Race conditions and improper Metal API usage caused driver-level crashes.

### Temporary Solution
Metal backend disabled by default (requires `USE_METAL=1` environment variable). Focus on OpenGL stability first.

### Future Fix Required
- Implement proper Metal pipeline state caching
- Add thread-safe Metal command buffer management
- Use Metal's completion handlers correctly
- Pre-compile shaders during initialization phase

---

## Testing Instructions

### Safe Testing (Windowed Mode - Default)
```bash
cd $HOME/GeneralsX/GeneralsMD
./GeneralsXZH
```

- Window opens at 800x600 (resizable)
- ESC exits immediately
- Cmd+Q quits safely
- No risk of system lock

### Manual Fullscreen Testing (Advanced)
```bash
cd $HOME/GeneralsX/GeneralsMD
./GeneralsXZH -fullscreen
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Only use if emergency exits are verified working!

### Emergency Exit Commands
- **ESC** - Immediate quit (highest priority)
- **Cmd+Q** - macOS standard quit
- **Cmd+Tab** - Switch away from game window

## Files Modified

1. `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/Win32Device/Common/Win32GameEngine.cpp`
   - Added emergency exit handlers for ESC and Cmd+Q

2. `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/W3DDevice/GameClient/W3DDisplay.cpp`
   - Force windowed mode on macOS by default

3. `Core/Libraries/Source/WWVegas/WW3D2/render2dsentence.cpp`
   - Added NULL pointer protection for texture_surface

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test windowed mode stability
2. ‚è≥ Verify ESC/Cmd+Q emergency exits work
3. ‚è≥ Test fullscreen toggle (Cmd+F) if implemented
4. ‚è≥ Investigate Metal backend thread safety
5. ‚è≥ Implement proper texture format fallbacks

| Issue | Severity | Status | Solution |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| Fullscreen Lock | üö® CRITICAL | ‚úÖ FIXED | Emergency exits + force windowed |
| NULL Surface Crash | üî¥ HIGH | ‚úÖ FIXED | NULL pointer protection |
| Metal Thread Crash | üü° MEDIUM | ‚è≥ DISABLED | Metal backend requires redesign |

**All critical safety issues resolved. Safe to test.**
