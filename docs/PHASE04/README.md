# Phase 04: Memory & Threading

**Phase**: 04  
**Title**: Memory & Threading  
**Area**: OS API Layer (win32_sdl_api_compat)  
**Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: not-started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 01, Phase 02

## Quick reminders

- Use `Fail fast` approach when testing new changes, if something is not working as expected, stop and investigate immediately;
- Focus on finish `GeneralsXZH`, then backport to `GeneralsX`;
- See `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md` for more specific details about above instructions.

## Objective

Implement cross-platform threading, synchronization primitives, and memory allocation hooks.

---

## Key Deliverables

- [ ] Thread creation wrapper (std::thread / pthread)
- [ ] Mutex and condition variable wrappers
- [ ] Critical section equivalent
- [ ] Memory allocation hooks with statistics
- [ ] Performance counter abstraction

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Build & Compilation
- [ ] Compiles without new errors
- [ ] All platforms build successfully (macOS ARM64, x86_64, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### Runtime Behavior
- [ ] All planned features functional
- [ ] No crashes or undefined behavior
- [ ] Performance meets targets

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-platform validation complete

## Technical Details

### Compatibility Layer: {compat_layer}

**Pattern**: `source_dest_type_compat`  
**Purpose**: {title}

Implementation details and code examples will be added as phase is developed.
