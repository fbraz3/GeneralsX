# Phase 07: Swapchain & Presentation

**Phase**: 07  
**Title**: Swapchain & Presentation  
**Area**: Graphics Layer (d3d8_vulkan_graphics_compat)  
**Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: COMPLETE (Phase 40)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 06

---

## Objective

Vulkan swapchain creation and frame presentation (ALREADY COMPLETE in Phase 40)

---

## Key Deliverables

- [ ] VkSwapchainKHR creation for each platform
- [ ] Frame acquisition and presentation
- [ ] Out-of-date swapchain handling
- [ ] Triple-buffering support

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Build & Compilation

- [ ] All platforms build successfully (macOS ARM64, x86_64, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### Runtime Behavior
- [ ] All planned features functional
- [ ] No crashes or undefined behavior
- [ ] Performance meets targets

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-platform validation complete

---

## Technical Details

### Compatibility Layer: {compat_layer}

**Pattern**: `source_dest_type_compat`  
**Purpose**: {title}

Implementation details and code examples will be added as phase is developed.
