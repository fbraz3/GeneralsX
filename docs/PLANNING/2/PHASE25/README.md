## Quick reminders

- Use `Fail fast` approach when testing new changes, if something is not working as expected, stop and investigate immediately;
- Focus on finish `GeneralsXZH`, then backport to `GeneralsX`;
- See `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md` for more specific details about above instructions.
- before start, check if there are some integration missing from previous phases, then fix it before proceed.
