# Phase 32: Audio System

**Estimated Time**: 1 week  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Enhances game experience but not blocking

## Overview

Implement audio playback system using SDL2 and integrate with Miles Sound System for music, sound effects, and 3D positional audio.

## Tasks

### Phase 32.1: SDL2 Audio Initialization (2 days)

- SDL2 audio subsystem setup
- Audio device enumeration
- Sample rate and buffer configuration
- Audio callback system

### Phase 32.2: Miles Sound System Integration (3 days)

- Miles Sound System library integration
- MP3/WAV playback support
- Volume control and mixing
- Audio stream management

### Phase 32.3: 3D Audio Positioning (2 days)

- Spatial audio calculations
- Distance attenuation
- Stereo panning based on camera position
- Doppler effect (optional)

## Files to Modify

- `Core/GameEngine/Source/Common/Audio/` - Audio subsystem
- `cmake/miles.cmake` - Miles Sound System build configuration
- SDL2 audio integration in main engine loop

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Background music plays in menus
- ✅ Sound effects trigger on events
- ✅ 3D audio positioning works in-game
- ✅ Volume controls functional
- ✅ No audio stuttering or crackling

## Dependencies

- Phase 30: Metal Backend ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 31: Texture System (for UI feedback)
- SDL2 library (already integrated)
- Miles Sound System library

## Notes

Audio system is independent from graphics rendering and can be tested separately. Miles Sound System is the original audio engine used by C&C Generals.
