# GeneralsX - Cross-Platform Command & Conquer: Generals

A comprehensive cross-platform port of Command & Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour, bringing the classic RTS experience to **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows** through modern OpenGL rendering and extensive platform compatibility layers.

## 🎉 Project Evolution

This project was born as a fork to provide public releases of the [TheSuperHackers](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode) project.

Since the [public releases PR](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode/pull/929) was officially integrated into the original project, I decided to change the project's focus.

This repository now focuses on **experimental cross-platform development** and serves as the technical foundation for multi-platform support. For **official releases and stable builds** (Windows only), visit:

### 🌍 Cross-Platform Vision

This project transforms the Windows-exclusive Command & Conquer: Generals into a truly cross-platform game:

- **🍎 macOS Native Support** - Full compatibility with Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
- **🐧 Linux Distribution** - Native builds for major Linux distributions
- **🪟 Windows Enhanced** - Improved stability and modern graphics support
- **🎮 Unified Experience** - Consistent gameplay across all platforms
- **🔧 Modern Architecture** - Updated from VC6/C++98 to modern C++20 standards

### 🚀 Current Port Status

**Phase 23.8 – MetaMap hardened; MapCache under protection**

**✅ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS**:
- ✅ 100% compilation success on macOS (ARM64)
- ✅ Engine subsystem progress: 30/42 subsystems (71%) operational
- ✅ Memory safety: stack buffer overflow fixed in LanguageFilter; widespread NULL/Bounds guards
- ✅ Cross-platform: Win32→POSIX compatibility layer stable
- ✅ Universal INI Protection: resilient parsing across hundreds of INIs
- ✅ MetaMap stabilized: localized and fallback CommandMap.ini load flow hardened
- ✅ MapCache protections: numPlayers clamped; waypoint access bounds-checked; map scan guards

**🎯 ENGINE SUBSYSTEM STATUS**:
- ✅ Functional: 30/42 subsystems (71%) – file system, audio, content, UI
- 🔄 Testing: 7/42 subsystems (17%) – AI, game logic, player management
- 🎯 Remaining: 5/42 subsystems (12%) – late-phase logic and validation
- � Current focus: Map systems (MapCache parsing and scanning) under protection

**🔧 CURRENT FOCUS**:
- Map systems hardening – Continue guarding MapCache parse/scan and rebuild flows
- Graphics pipeline validation – W3D/OpenGL path stability with DX8 mocks
- Final subsystem validation – Complete the remaining ~12% initialization

**Platform Status**:
- **macOS**: Compiles ✅, Links ✅, Engine 87% operational 🎯
- **Linux**: Planned for Q1 2026 based on macOS foundation 📅
- **Windows**: Enhanced compatibility maintained ✅

### 🛠 Platform Support Status

| Platform | Status | Graphics API | Build System | Documentation |
|----------|--------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **macOS** | 🟡 Runtime Debugging (Map systems) | OpenGL | CMake/Ninja ✅ | [docs/MACOS_BUILD.md](docs/MACOS_BUILD.md) |
| **Linux** | � Planned Q1 2026 | OpenGL | CMake/Ninja ✅ | [docs/LINUX_BUILD.md](docs/LINUX_BUILD.md) |
| **Windows** | ✅ Enhanced | DirectX 8 + OpenGL | CMake/Ninja ✅ | Windows-native |

### 🎮 Features

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
- Native compilation on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Unified configuration system replacing Windows Registry
- Cross-platform networking and multiplayer support
- Platform-native file system integration

**Graphics Enhancements**:
- OpenGL rendering pipeline for modern GPU compatibility
- Maintained DirectX 8 support for Windows legacy systems
- Improved texture loading and memory management
- Enhanced graphics debugging and profiling tools

**Why OpenGL over Vulkan?**

We chose OpenGL as our cross-platform graphics API for several strategic reasons:

- **🍎 macOS Native Support**: macOS deprecated OpenGL but still provides native support, while Vulkan requires complex wrapper layers (MoltenVK) that translate Vulkan calls to Metal, adding unnecessary complexity and potential performance overhead
- **🕰 Legacy Compatibility**: The original game engine was designed for DirectX 8 (2002), making OpenGL's more traditional immediate-mode approach a natural fit for porting existing rendering code
- **🔧 Development Speed**: OpenGL's simpler state machine aligns better with the original graphics architecture, allowing faster porting with fewer fundamental code rewrites
- **📚 Mature Ecosystem**: OpenGL has decades of documentation, debugging tools, and community knowledge that accelerates development
- **🎯 Sufficient Performance**: For a 2003 RTS game, OpenGL provides more than adequate performance while maintaining broad hardware compatibility
- **🖥 Hardware Support**: OpenGL works excellently on older hardware that C&C Generals players might still be using, including integrated graphics
- **⚡ Future Path**: The OpenGL foundation can be enhanced with modern extensions or eventually serve as a stepping stone to Vulkan if needed

This approach prioritizes **getting the game running cross-platform quickly** rather than chasing cutting-edge graphics performance that the original game design doesn't require.

**Modern Development**:
- Updated from Visual C++ 6.0 to modern C++20 standards
- CMake build system for consistent cross-platform builds
- Comprehensive test suite for validation across platforms
- Automated CI/CD for continuous integration

### 📋 Implementation Architecture

**Multi-Layer Compatibility System**:

1. **Core Layer** (`Core/Libraries/Source/WWVegas/WW3D2/win32_compat.h`)
   - Foundation Windows API types and functions
   - Cross-platform memory, threading, filesystem operations
   - DirectX base structures and constants

2. **Game-Specific Layers** (`Generals/` and `GeneralsMD/`)
   - Extended DirectX 8 interfaces and methods
   - Game-specific functionality and assets
   - Version-specific compatibility implementations

3. **Platform Abstraction**
   - Conditional compilation for platform-specific code
   - Unified API surface with platform-native backends
   - Resource management and error handling

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### 🧵 Multithreading Modernization

This is a future initiative to leverage multi-core CPUs while preserving deterministic gameplay. High-level plan:
- Start with low-risk tasks (parallel asset/INI loading, background audio/I/O)
- Evolve to moderate threading (AI batches, object updates with partitioning)
- Consider advanced loop decoupling (producer–consumer) once stable
