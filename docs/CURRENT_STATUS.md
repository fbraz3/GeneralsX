# GeneralsX - Current Status Report

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Platform**: macOS ARM64  
**Status**: ⚠️ WINDOW OPENS, BLACK SCREEN (EXPECTED)

## What's Working ✅

### Metal Backend (Phase 29)
- ✅ Metal device initialization
- ✅ Metal command queue creation
- ✅ CAMetalLayer attached to SDL2 window
- ✅ Basic triangle rendering pipeline
- ✅ MSL shader compilation (vertex + fragment)
- ✅ SDL2 window creation (800x600, windowed mode)
- ✅ Viewport configuration

### SDL2 Integration (Phase 27.1)
- ✅ SDL2 event loop working
- ✅ Emergency exit handlers (ESC, Cmd+Q)
- ✅ Forced windowed mode (prevents system lock)
- ✅ Window creation and management

### Safety Fixes
- ✅ No more fullscreen lock (hard reset issue fixed)
- ✅ NULL surface protection (no crashes)
- ✅ Can exit anytime with ESC

## What's NOT Working ❌

### Missing Components

#### 1. Texture System (Phase 28) - CRITICAL
**Problem**: No textures = no sprites, no UI, no graphics  
**Impact**: Black screen - nothing visible except window  
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What's missing**:
- DDS file loading (.dds texture format used by game)
- DXT1/DXT3/DXT5 decompression (compressed texture formats)
- TGA file loading (fallback format)
- Metal texture creation from loaded data
- Texture binding to render pipeline

**Files needed**:
- `TextureLoader.cpp/h` - DDS/TGA loader
- Metal texture upload in `metalwrapper.mm`
- Integration with `TextureClass`

#### 2. Draw Call Integration
**Problem**: Metal pipeline exists but nothing calls it  
**Impact**: Viewport loops infinitely, no actual rendering  
**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**What's missing**:
- DX8Wrapper → Metal routing
- Vertex buffer data upload
- Index buffer data upload
- Draw call translation (DrawPrimitive, DrawIndexedPrimitive)
- Render state management

#### 3. Game Loop Integration
**Problem**: Game's rendering loop not connected to Metal  
**Impact**: Viewport resets repeatedly (loop issue)  
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What's missing**:
- Frame begin/end synchronization
- Present/swap buffers integration
- Command buffer submission
- Triple buffering management

## Current Behavior

```bash
cd $HOME/GeneralsX/GeneralsMD
USE_METAL=1 ./GeneralsXZH
```

**What happens**:
1. Engine initializes (BIG files, INI parsing, subsystems)
2. Metal backend initializes successfully
3. SDL2 window opens (800x600, gray/blue screen)
4. Viewport configuration loops infinitely
5. **Black screen** - nothing renders
6. Can exit with ESC (safe)

**Logs**:
```
Phase 29: Initializing Metal backend...
METAL: Initialized (device, queue, layer, triangle pipeline)
Phase 29: Metal backend initialized successfully
Phase 27.1.3: SDL2 window created (800x600, windowed)
Phase 27.4.7: Viewport set to (0, 0, 800 x 600), depth [0.00 - 1.00]
Phase 27.4.7: Viewport set to (0, 0, 800 x 600), depth [0.00 - 1.00]
Phase 27.4.7: Viewport set to (0, 0, 800 x 600), depth [0.00 - 1.00]
... (infinite loop)
```

## Why Black Screen is Expected

### Missing Rendering Pipeline Components

1. **No Textures**
   - Menu background image: DDS texture
   - UI elements: DDS/TGA textures
   - Splash screen: DDS texture
   - Without texture loading, NOTHING can be displayed

2. **No Draw Calls**
   - Game calls DX8 DrawPrimitive/DrawIndexedPrimitive
   - These calls need to be routed to Metal
   - Currently, calls are NOPs (no operation)

3. **No Asset Loading**
   - Game assets are in .big files
   - Textures need to be extracted and loaded
   - Currently, texture loading returns empty/black textures

## Comparison with OpenGL

| Component | OpenGL | Metal |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Window creation | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Context/Device | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Shader compilation | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Viewport | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Texture loading | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing |
| Draw calls | ❌ Stubbed | ❌ Stubbed |
| Black screen | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

**Both backends have the same issue**: Foundation works, but rendering pipeline incomplete.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 28: Texture System (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Estimated**: 2-3 weeks  
**Complexity**: High

**Tasks**:
1. DDS header parsing and validation
2. DXT1/DXT3/DXT5 decompression
3. Metal texture creation (MTLTexture)
4. TGA loading (fallback format)
5. Texture binding to pipelines
6. Mipmap generation
7. Format conversion (BGRA → RGBA, etc)

**Why first**: Without textures, NOTHING can be displayed - this is the blocker.

### Phase 29.2: Metal Draw Calls
**Estimated**: 1-2 weeks  
**Complexity**: Medium

**Tasks**:
1. Vertex buffer upload (MTLBuffer)
2. Index buffer upload (MTLBuffer)
3. DrawPrimitive → Metal renderCommandEncoder
4. DrawIndexedPrimitive → Metal renderCommandEncoder
5. Render state management (blend, depth, stencil)
6. Uniform buffer updates (matrices, materials)

### Phase 29.3: Game Loop Integration
**Estimated**: 1 week  
**Complexity**: Medium

**Tasks**:
1. Frame synchronization (begin/end)
2. Command buffer submission
3. Present/swap buffers
4. Triple buffering
5. V-sync control

## Alternative: OpenGL First Approach

**Recommendation**: Focus on **OpenGL** instead of Metal for initial port.

**Why**:
- OpenGL wrapper already has more infrastructure
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Metal is macOS-only
- Same texture system works for both
- Can add Metal later as optimization

**Strategy**:
1. Complete Phase 28 (Texture System) for OpenGL
2. Get OpenGL rendering working first
3. Use OpenGL as reference for Metal implementation
4. Add Metal backend later for native macOS performance

## Testing Recommendations

### Current Testing (Safe)
```bash
# With Metal (black screen expected)
cd $HOME/GeneralsX/GeneralsMD
USE_METAL=1 ./GeneralsXZH

# Press ESC to exit safely
```

### What to Look For
- ✅ Window opens without crash
- ✅ Can exit with ESC
- ✅ No system freeze
- ⚠️ Black screen is EXPECTED (not a bug)
- ⚠️ Viewport loop is known issue

### When to Expect Graphics
**After Phase 28 texture system is complete**:
- Textures will load from .big files
- Menu background will appear
- UI elements will render
- Game will be playable

**Estimated**: 2-3 weeks of development for basic texture support

## Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Engine initialization | ✅ Complete | All subsystems load |
| Metal backend | ✅ Complete | Device, pipeline, shaders |
| SDL2 window | ✅ Complete | Windowed mode, event loop |
| Safety features | ✅ Complete | ESC exit, no crashes |
| **Texture loading** | ❌ **MISSING** | **BLOCKER** |
| Draw calls | ❌ Stubbed | Needs DX8→Metal routing |
| Game loop | ⚠️ Partial | Viewport loops |
| **Visible graphics** | ❌ **BLACK SCREEN** | **Expected** |

## Conclusion

The black screen is **expected and normal** at this stage. The Metal backend foundation is solid, but we need the texture system (Phase 28) before anything can be displayed. This is the same situation as the OpenGL backend.

**Current milestone**: Infrastructure complete, ready for Phase 28 texture implementation.

**Next session**: Begin Phase 28 texture system or switch to OpenGL-first approach.
