      "content": "GeneralsX is a community-driven cross-platform port of Command & Conquer: Generals Zero Hour (2003), targeting Linux, macOS, and Windows under a single codebase. The primary target is GeneralsXZH (Zero Hour expansion in GeneralsMD/), with GeneralsX (base game in Generals/) as secondary. Both share a large C++ engine (~500k+ LOC) originally built for Windows with VC6/DirectX8/Miles Sound System. The cross-platform strategy uses SDL3 (windowing/input), DXVK (DirectX 8→Vulkan graphics on all platforms), OpenAL (audio replacing Miles Sound System), and 64-bit native architecture, while preserving retail compatibility and legacy Windows builds.",

Platform-specific code must be isolated to Core/GameEngineDevice/ and Core/Libraries/Source/Platform/. Never put platform-specific code inside gameplay logic (GameLogic/). SDL3 is the unified platform layer — no native POSIX, Win32, or Cocoa calls in game code.",

Each platform may be developed on a separate branch and merged to main as it stabilizes. Key scripts in scripts/. Build logs go to logs/. DXVK headers are fetched via CMake FetchContent into build/_deps/dxvk-src/ and require pre-guard patches for type conflicts (MEMORYSTATUS, IUnknown).",
