# Phase 02: SDL2 Window & Event Loop

**Phase**: 02  
**Title**: SDL2 Window & Event Loop  
**Area**: OS API Layer (win32_sdl_api_compat)  
**Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: not-started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 00, Phase 00.5

## Quick reminders

- Use `Fail fast` approach when testing new changes, if something is not working as expected, stop and investigate immediately;
- Focus on finish `GeneralsXZH`, then backport to `GeneralsX`;
- See `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md` for more specific details about above instructions.

---

## Objective

Replace Windows-specific window creation and message loop with cross-platform SDL2 equivalents.

---

## Key Deliverables

- [ ] SDL2 library integrated into CMake build system
- [ ] Cross-platform window creation via SDL2
- [ ] Main event loop polling SDL2 events
- [ ] Input event translation (SDL2 → Win32 constants)
- [ ] Window sizing, fullscreen, VSync support

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Build & Compilation
- [ ] Compiles without new errors
- [ ] All platforms build successfully (macOS ARM64, x86_64, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### Runtime Behavior
- [ ] All planned features functional
- [ ] No crashes or undefined behavior
- [ ] Performance meets targets

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-platform validation complete

## Technical Details

### Compatibility Layer: {compat_layer}

**Pattern**: `source_dest_type_compat`  
**Purpose**: {title}

Implementation details and code examples will be added as phase is developed.
