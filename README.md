# GeneralsX - Cross-Platform Command & Conquer: Generals

A comprehensive cross-platform port of Command & Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour, bringing the classic RTS experience to **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows** through modern OpenGL rendering and extensive platform compatibility layers.

## 🎉 Project Evolution

This project was born as a fork to provide public releases of the [TheSuperHackers](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode) project.

Since the [public releases PR](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode/pull/929) was officially integrated into the original project, I decided to change the project's focus.

This repository now focuses on **experimental cross-platform development** and serves as the technical foundation for multi-platform support. For **official releases and stable builds** (Windows only), visit:

| **Linux** | � Planned Q1 2026 | OpenGL | CMake/Ninja ✅ | [LINUX_BUILD.md](LINUX_BUILD.md) |
| **Windows** | ✅ Enhanced | DirectX 8 + OpenGL | CMake/Ninja ✅ | Windows-native |

### 🎮 Features

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
- Native compilation on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Unified configuration system replacing Windows Registry
- Cross-platform networking and multiplayer support
- Platform-native file system integration

**Graphics Enhancements**:
- OpenGL rendering pipeline for modern GPU compatibility
- Maintained DirectX 8 support for Windows legacy systems
- Improved texture loading and memory management
- Enhanced graphics debugging and profiling tools

**Why OpenGL over Vulkan?**

We chose OpenGL as our cross-platform graphics API for several strategic reasons:

- **🍎 macOS Native Support**: macOS deprecated OpenGL but still provides native support, while Vulkan requires complex wrapper layers (MoltenVK) that translate Vulkan calls to Metal, adding unnecessary complexity and potential performance overhead
- **🕰 Legacy Compatibility**: The original game engine was designed for DirectX 8 (2002), making OpenGL's more traditional immediate-mode approach a natural fit for porting existing rendering code
- **🔧 Development Speed**: OpenGL's simpler state machine aligns better with the original graphics architecture, allowing faster porting with fewer fundamental code rewrites
- **📚 Mature Ecosystem**: OpenGL has decades of documentation, debugging tools, and community knowledge that accelerates development
- **🎯 Sufficient Performance**: For a 2003 RTS game, OpenGL provides more than adequate performance while maintaining broad hardware compatibility
- **🖥 Hardware Support**: OpenGL works excellently on older hardware that C&C Generals players might still be using, including integrated graphics
- **⚡ Future Path**: The OpenGL foundation can be enhanced with modern extensions or eventually serve as a stepping stone to Vulkan if needed

This approach prioritizes **getting the game running cross-platform quickly** rather than chasing cutting-edge graphics performance that the original game design doesn't require.

**Modern Development**:
- Updated from Visual C++ 6.0 to modern C++20 standards
- CMake build system for consistent cross-platform builds
- Comprehensive test suite for validation across platforms
- Automated CI/CD for continuous integration

### 📋 Implementation Architecture

**Multi-Layer Compatibility System**:

1. **Core Layer** (`Core/Libraries/Source/WWVegas/WW3D2/win32_compat.h`)
   - Foundation Windows API types and functions
   - Cross-platform memory, threading, filesystem operations
   - DirectX base structures and constants

2. **Game-Specific Layers** (`Generals/` and `GeneralsMD/`)
   - Extended DirectX 8 interfaces and methods
   - Game-specific functionality and assets
   - Version-specific compatibility implementations

3. **Platform Abstraction**
   - Conditional compilation for platform-specific code
   - Unified API surface with platform-native backends
   - Resource management and error handling

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### 🧵 Multithreading Modernization

*Note: This is a **future implementation** planned after achieving stable cross-platform compilation and basic functionality.*

Command & Conquer: Generals (2003) was designed for single-core CPUs and presents significant opportunities for modernization to leverage multiple CPU cores.

#### **Current Architecture**
- **Single-threaded main loop**: Logic → AI → Physics → Rendering (sequential)
- **Limited threading**: Only networking, audio, and I/O operations
- **Existing infrastructure**: ThreadClass, CriticalSectionClass, Mutex primitives available

#### **Modernization Opportunities**

**Phase 1: Low-Risk Optimizations**
- **Parallel Asset Loading** (40-60% faster startup)
- **Background Audio Processing** (10-15% CPU reduction)
- **Parallel INI File Parsing** (faster initialization)

**Phase 2: Moderate Complexity**
- **Threaded AI Processing** (20-30% AI performance boost)
- **Parallel Object Updates** (30-50% logic performance)
- **Background Resource Management**

**Phase 3: Advanced Architecture**
- **Producer-Consumer Game Loop** (25-40% overall FPS improvement)
- **Task-Based Parallelism** with dependency management
- **NUMA-aware thread allocation**

#### **Technical Challenges**
- **Deterministic Multiplayer**: Threading can introduce desynchronization
- **Shared State Management**: GameObject data accessed by multiple systems
- **Order-Dependent Logic**: Game systems require specific execution sequences

#### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Foundation Phase** (2-3 weeks): Thread pool infrastructure and safe parallelization
2. **Safe Enhancements** (4-6 weeks): Background processing and non-critical parallelization
3. **Core Loop Modernization** (8-12 weeks): Advanced threading with careful state management

#### **Expected Performance Impact**
- **4-core systems**: 40-60% performance improvement
- **8-core systems**: Optimal scaling with diminishing returns
- **Requirements**: Minimum 2+ cores, optimal with 4-8 cores

#### **Why After Cross-Platform Stability**
Multithreading introduces complexity that could mask platform-specific issues. Our approach:
1. ✅ **First**: Achieve stable single-threaded execution on all platforms
2. ✅ **Then**: Add controlled parallelization with extensive testing
3. ✅ **Finally**: Advanced threading optimizations

This ensures each enhancement builds on a solid, tested foundation rather than adding complexity to unstable systems.
