# Phase 33: Game Logic Validation

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Core gameplay functionality

## Overview

Validate and fix core game logic systems including UI interaction, input handling, basic AI, pathfinding, and collision detection.

## Tasks

### Phase 33.1: UI Interactive System (4-5 days)

- Menu navigation (mouse hover, click)
- Button state management (normal, hover, pressed)
- Text input fields
- Checkbox and radio button controls
- Dropdown menus

### Phase 33.2: Input System (3-4 days)

- Mouse input handling (position, buttons, wheel)
- Keyboard input (key press, release, modifiers)
- Input event queue management
- Camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate)
- Unit selection (click, drag box)

### Phase 33.3: Basic AI System (5-6 days)
- Unit state machines (idle, move, attack)
- Target acquisition and tracking
- Formation movement
- Build queue management
- Resource gathering logic

### Phase 33.4: Pathfinding & Collision (3-4 days)

- A* pathfinding algorithm validation
- Obstacle avoidance
- Unit collision detection
- Terrain traversability checks
- Dynamic path updates

## Files to Modify

- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/Common/GameLogic/` - Game logic systems
- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/Common/Input/` - Input handling
- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/Common/AI/` - AI systems
- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/Common/Physics/` - Collision detection

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Menu buttons respond to clicks
- ✅ Camera moves with keyboard/mouse
- ✅ Units can be selected and commanded
- ✅ AI units move and attack properly
- ✅ Pathfinding avoids obstacles
- ✅ No collision bugs or stuck units

## Dependencies

- Phase 30: Metal Backend ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 31: Texture System (for UI visuals)
- Phase 32: Audio System (for UI feedback sounds)

## Notes

This phase focuses on validating existing game logic code works correctly on macOS. Most systems are already implemented but need testing and bug fixes for cross-platform compatibility.
