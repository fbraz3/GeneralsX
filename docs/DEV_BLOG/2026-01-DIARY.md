# GeneralsX Development Diary - 2026-01

## 2026-01-07

### Summary

- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to be concise and aligned with the repo’s current Vulkan-first workflow (CMake presets + helper scripts).
- Documented the practical build/run/debug entry points (including `scripts/runTerminal.sh` timeout behavior) and clarified that `tests/` is ad-hoc (no CTest wiring).
- Included small housekeeping edits already present in the working tree (minor markdown heading cleanup and comment whitespace).
