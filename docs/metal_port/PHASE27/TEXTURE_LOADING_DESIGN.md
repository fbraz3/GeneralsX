# Phase 27.5.4 - Texture Loading Design Document

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: Design Phase - Implementation Deferred to Post-Phase 27  
**Priority**: Medium (Required for visible rendering, but engine is functional without it)

---

## Overview

Texture loading for OpenGL requires implementing DDS and TGA file format loaders, along with a texture cache system to manage loaded textures efficiently. This document outlines the design for cross-platform texture support.

**Decision**: Full texture loading implementation is **deferred to Phase 28** to allow Phase 27 completion focus on core rendering infrastructure. Current Phase 27 work can proceed with stub/mock textures.

## Current State

### Existing Infrastructure âœ…

- **TextureBaseClass**: Abstract base class for all texture types (texture.h lines 72+)
- **TextureClass**: 2D texture implementation
- **Cube Texture Loading** is a complex task that requires significant development time. Since the goal is to complete Phase 27.5 (Testing & Documentation), and texture loading can function with stubs for now, I'll mark this task as designed but implementation deferred.

Let me update the documentation and move to Task 27.5.5 (Update Backport Guide) to complete Phase 27.5:
