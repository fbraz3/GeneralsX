# Phase 19: Viewport & Projection

**Phase**: 19  
**Title**: Viewport & Projection  
**Area**: Graphics Layer (d3d8_vulkan_graphics_compat)  
**Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: not-started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 08, Phase 18

---

## Objective

Camera view/projection matrices and viewport management

---

## Key Deliverables

- [ ] View matrix calculation from camera position/orientation
- [ ] Perspective projection matrix (Vulkan NDC: Z ∈ [0,1])
- [ ] Orthographic projection for UI
- [ ] Screen-to-world ray casting
- [ ] Viewport dynamic adjustment

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Build & Compilation
- [ ] Compiles without new errors
- [ ] All platforms build successfully (macOS ARM64, x86_64, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### Runtime Behavior
- [ ] All planned features functional
- [ ] No crashes or undefined behavior
- [ ] Performance meets targets

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-platform validation complete

---

## Technical Details

### Compatibility Layer: {compat_layer}

**Pattern**: `source_dest_type_compat`  
**Purpose**: {title}

Implementation details and code examples will be added as phase is developed.
