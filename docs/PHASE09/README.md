# Phase 08: Render Pass & Pipeline

**Phase**: 08  
**Title**: Render Pass & Pipeline  
**Area**: Graphics Layer (d3d8_vulkan_graphics_compat)  
**Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: COMPLETE (Phase 40)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 07

- [ ] No crashes or undefined behavior
- [ ] Performance meets targets

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-platform validation complete
