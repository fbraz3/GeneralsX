# Phase 27: Game Object System

**Phase**: 27  
**Title**: Game Object System  
**Area**: Game Logic  
**Scope**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: not-started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 04

## Quick reminders

- Use `Fail fast` approach when testing new changes, if something is not working as expected, stop and investigate immediately;
- Focus on finish `GeneralsXZH`, then backport to `GeneralsX`;
- See `.github/instructions/project.instructions.md` for more specific details about above instructions.
